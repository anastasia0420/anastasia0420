- 👋 Hi, I’m @anastasia0420
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, particularly in solving complex problems using mathematics and computer science. These subjects have always been more than just academic areas for me — they offer a way to create solutions that can improve and simplify our lives. I’m especially interested in how technology can be applied to education, helping people learn more efficiently. I’m also passionate about teaching and constantly strive to develop approaches that make learning engaging and accessible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development, focusing on both frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend (Node.js, Express). In addition, I’m actively learning Python, which fascinates me for its versatility and potential to solve a wide range of tasks, from web development to data analysis and machine learning. My goal is to master building reliable and scalable web applications, as well as using Python to automate processes and develop intelligent systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on educational projects and web application development
